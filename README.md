**About Me**

I am a Software Engineer with deep expertise in mobile app development, specializing in Swift, SwiftUI, Kotlin, and Jetpack Compose. Iâ€™ve been building apps since 2018, following 8 years of experience as an Electrical Engineer. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge with the mobile dev community through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jpmtechdev) and [technical blog](https://medium.com/@jpmtech), where I create content on iOS and Android development.
